* Starintel gserver
Starintel gserver is the new API server for interacting with the starintel system.



- Features:
  - rabbitmq
  - actor model
  - hackable


** *WARNINGS*
*** Project status
This repo is a mess!
This project is experimental, DO NOT EXPOSE TO THE WEB.

*** Consumers and actors

In a future version the consumer that inserts will revert back to cl-gserver actor when I figure a good proto and learn more about sento.

Something along the lines of

#+begin_src lisp
(tell *couchdb* (:db "starintel" :id "0HJY....." :document (as-json (spec:create-user :dataset "github" :name "lost-rob0t"))))
#+end_src

I will have to do more research to better utlize the sento system.
